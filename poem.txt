This is where my poem is.
Title: Life...
Poem:
I sit in summer
The days till fall slowly tick away, what a bummer
Fall has come
I sit inside chewing gum
It is now winter and the tree shivers in the cold
This is a scene I behold
The next month comes
It is spring and I have comes
I twist my thumbs 
Soon summer will come...
